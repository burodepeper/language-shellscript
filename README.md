# Shell script language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/language-shellscript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/language-shellscript)
Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to shell scripts in Atom, originally forked from the official [`language-shellscript`](https://atom.io/packages/language-shellscript) package on 2 June 2016. It has a number of improvements over the original, namely:

* It has syntax-highlighting for common Unix commands, such as those provided by the GNU Coreutils package, along with:
  - `grep`
  - `sed`
  - `sudo`

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, *etc.*
