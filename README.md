# Shell script language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/language-shellscript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/language-shellscript)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to shell scripts in Atom, originally forked from the official [`language-shellscript`](https://atom.io/packages/language-shellscript) package on 2 June 2016. It has a number of improvements over the original, namely:

* It has syntax-highlighting for common Unix commands, along with syntax-highlighting for several popular &#42;nix package managers like APT, DNF, pacman, Portage, *etc.*
* Syntax-highlighting for variable definitions

If you use this package it is recommended you use the [`dark-bint-syntax`](https://github.com/Murriouz/dark-bint-syntax) theme of Murriouz.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, *etc.*
